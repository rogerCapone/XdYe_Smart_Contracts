In this section we are going to explain at a high-level all the main Smart Contracts that will regulate XdYe business logic.

In order to understand the overall contract interaction we have designed a diagram that tries to summarize it. This does not represent all possible interactions that our XdYe platform can handle, it is a simple representation to understand the main contract relations that allow XdYe to operate as a DEX with Staking and Farming Capabilities.
